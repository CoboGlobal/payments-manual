In addition to automatic settlement during pay-in, you can manually allocate funds between accounts using the Allocate feature in the Payments App. This allows you to:

- Allocate funds from the developer account to a merchant account
- Allocate funds from a merchant account to the developer account
- Allocate funds between two merchant accounts

## Steps

1. Navigate to the **Balance** page in the Payments App.
2. Click the **Allocate** button.
3. Fill in the allocation form:
   - **From**: Select the source account (developer account or a merchant account).
   - **Token**: Select the token you want to allocate. You can only allocate one token at a time.
   - **Amount**: Enter the amount to allocate.
   - **To**: Select the destination account.
   - **Description**: Optionally enter a description for the allocation.
4. Click **Preview** to review the allocation details.
5. Confirm the allocation.
